Shipment route analysis: Logistics Dashboard
An Interactive data visualization to understand and visualize key logistic metrics.

This Power BI dashboard tracks and visualizes key logistics metrics—such as delivery times, shipment volumes, and route efficiency—to monitor operational performance across the supply chain. It exists to help identify bottlenecks, reduce delays, and support data-driven decisions that improve overall logistics efficiency and customer satisfaction

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
•	📊 Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization platform used for report creation.
•	📂 Power Query – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.
•	🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.
•	📝 Data Modeling – Relationships established among tables.
•	📁 File Format – .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.
